# Feed-Parser
Robust RSS, Atom Feed Parser written in C++

When I was looking into various C++ Feed Parsers, not many were as useful or did not have a good documentation.
So I went ahead and started creating my own Feed Parser.
This library is heavily based upon C++14

## Advantages

 - It uses threads to manage the downloading process.
 - The images downloaded are stored in memory and can be accessed very easily for use with other libraries
 - Very low memory usage
 - Customized for all feed types

Hats off to @hijang and @Cheedong for their great libraries
